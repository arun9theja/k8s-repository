          # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
          # choice for the user. This also increases chances pods run on environments with little
          # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
          # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
